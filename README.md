# AutoBot
AutoBot is a basic Auto-moderation Discord Bot which was developed for minor project in 6th semester of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at St. Andrews Institute of Technology and Management

I submitted the minor project in July, 2021. 

I am developing this bot with time. And, the sole purpose of source code for AutoBot (main.py file in AutoBot repository) is learning and reference.

Source code can be used by me or anyone for reference.
